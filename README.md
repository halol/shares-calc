## Requirements
* node `^5.0.0` (`6.11.0` suggested)
* yarn `^0.23.0` or npm `^3.0.0`

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `yarn` or `npm install`

2. Start Development server: `yarn start` or `npm start`

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `npm start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`npm run <script>`    |Description|
|-------------------|-----------|
|`start`            |Serves your app at `localhost:3000` and displays [Webpack Dashboard](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard)|
|`start:simple`     |Serves your app at `localhost:3000` without [Webpack Dashboard](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard)|
|`build`            |Builds the application to ./dist|
|`test`             |Runs unit tests with Karma. See [testing](#testing)|
|`test:watch`       |Runs `test` in watch mode to re-run tests when changed|
|`lint`             |[Lints](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8503559/what-is-linting) the project for potential errors|
|`lint:fix`         |Lints the project and [fixes all correctable errors](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface.html#fix)|

[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) is used to enable `prepush` hook capability. The `prepush` script currently runs `eslint`, which will keep you from pushing if there is any lint within your code. If you would like to disable this, remove the `prepush` script from the `package.json`.


## Application Structure

The application structure presented in this boilerplate is **fractal**, where functionality is grouped primarily by feature rather than file type. Please note, however, that this structure is only meant to serve as a guide, it is by no means prescriptive. That said, it aims to represent generally accepted guidelines and patterns for building scalable applications. If you wish to read more about this pattern, please check out this [awesome writeup](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit/wiki/Fractal-Project-Structure) by [Justin Greenberg](https://github.com/justingreenberg).

```

### Routing
We use `react-router` [route definitions](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/v3/docs/API.md#plainroute) (`<route>/index.js`) to define units of logic within our application. See the [application structure](#application-structure) section for more information.

## Testing
To add a unit test, create a `.spec.js` file anywhere inside of `./tests`. Karma and webpack will automatically find these files, and Mocha and Chai will be available within your test without the need to import them.

## Production

Build code before deployment by running `npm run build`. There are multiple options below for types of deployment, if you are unsure, checkout the Firebase section.

### Deployment

Selecting [Heroku](http://heroku.com) from the deploy options when running the generator adds a `Procfile` as well as deploy configs in `.travis.yml` for out of the box deployment.

To deploy to [Heroku](http://heroku.com) through [Travis-CI](http://travis-ci.org):
1. Enable Repo on Travis-CI Account
2. Get API Key from Heroku Dashboard
3. Create a new App (this name will be used in travis env var)
4. Set the following environment vars within the Travis-CI repo settings page:
  * HEROKU_KEY - Your Heroku API key
  * APP - Your Heroku App name
